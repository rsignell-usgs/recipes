## Banana Souffles 
(serves 4, 15 minutes active, 30 minutes total)
Recipe by Eric Ripert

### Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
* 5 tablespoons sugar
* 2 firm, ripe bananas, mashed (1 1/4
cups)
* 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
* 1 large egg yolk
* 3 large egg whites
* Salt

### Recipe

Preheat the oven to 400°. Brush four 1-cup ramekins with melted butter. Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar to 1 of the ramekins and rotate it to coat with sugar. Tap the excess sugar into another ramekin and repeat until all the ramekins are coated with sugar.

In a food processor, puree the bananas with the lime juice, egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of the sugar until smooth. Scrape the banana mixture into a large bowl.

In a medium stainless steel bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and beat until firm and glossy. Using a rubber spatula, beat one-fourth of the beaten whites into the banana mixture, then gently fold in the remaining whites. 

Spoon the soufflé mixture into the prepared ramekins and tap them lightly on a countertop.

Transfer the soufflés to a baking sheet and bake in the center of the oven for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown and risen. Serve at once.
