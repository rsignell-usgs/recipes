## Turkey Tonnato

Super easy, fast, delicious and healthy version of vitello tonnato.

Serves 2.

In a food processor or blender, combine one 6 1/2 oz can drained tuna, 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas and 1/4 cup plain yogurt. With machine on, drizzle in 1/2 cup olive oil. Transfer to bowl; stir in 1/4 cup capers and 1/2 cup chopped mixed tarragon, dill and chives. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over slices of roast turkey breast (we just ask the deli to cut thick slices). Great with arugula on the side.

Tip: buy tuna in olive oil, and drain it into a measuring cup to use for part of the 1/2 cup!
