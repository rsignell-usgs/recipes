# Robert Steinberg's Fudgy Brownies

* 6 tablespoons salted butter, cut into cubes
* 8 ounces SCHARFFEN BERGER 70% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chunks
* 3/4 cup plus 2T sugar (200g)
* 1/2 t vanilla extract
* 2	large eggs
* 1/3 c	all-purpose flour

1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cut an 8 by 16-inch piece of parchment paper. Lightly butter the bottom of an 8"x8" pan (just to help the parchment stick) and then line it with the parchment, allowing the paper to extend evenly over the opposite sides (like a sling). 

2. Place the chocolate and butter in a large glass bowl, cover, and microwave for about 1min 15s until butter and chocolate is melted. 

3. With a wooden spoon, beat the sugar into the chocolate mixture. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add vanilla extract. Add the flour and mix vigorously until the batter is very glossy and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and tap the pan bottom on the countertop to level the batter. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a skewer in the center comes out moist but clean.

6. Let cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Remove the brownies from the pan using the parchment “handles,” and cool completely on the rack before cutting into 2-inch squares.
