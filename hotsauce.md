## Roasted Rooster Hot Sauce 

### Ingredients
* 20g garlic
* 225g hot peppers (e.g. habanero, aji limon)
* 50g brown sugar
* 15g salt
* 10g dry mustard
* 1/2t turmeric
* 1t cumin
* 1/2t coriander

### Recipe

Preheat the oven to 425Â°.  Line a baking sheet parchment paper or foil, roast whole peppers and whole garlic cloves (separated from bulb, but leave skins on) for about 20 minutes (or until soft).  Squeeze the roasted garlic out of cloves into a medium sauce pan.  Pop stems off of peppers and toss into the pan (skins and seeds are fine!).   Add other ingredients and simmer for 15 minutes.   Blend until smooth in blender. 

Note: this recipe is typically hotter than I like.  So I make another batch of hot sauce, but using red bell peppers instead of hot peppers, which need to roast for about 40 minutes. I then blend this "mild" sauce with the "hot" sauce until I get the level of heat I like!  I do it this way instead of throwing everything together because you never can tell how hot the "hot" sauce will be, so this gives me the ability to customize the ratio.
