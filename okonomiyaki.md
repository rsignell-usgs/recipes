## Okonomiyaki (serves 3-4)

Short-cut americanized version of the famous dish from Osaka-Hiroshima
region: cabbage/scallion pancakes with spicy mayo. I love this recipe
because it's healthy, quick, inexpensive and
delicious!    You can make it in 20 minutes start to finish!

### For the Spicy Mayo Sauce
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons sriracha, more or less to taste
### For the Cabbage & Scallion Pancakes
* 5 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups cabbage, shredded with a mandoline or finely chopped
* 1 bunch scallions, trimmed and chopped
* 1 can baby shrimp or 3/4 cup chopped shrimp (or chicken, or tofu, or...)
* 1/3 cup canola oil for frying (roughly 1 tablespoon per pancake, using more or less as needed)
* 1-2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Whisk the first set of ingredients together and voila, your sauce. Set aside while you make the pancakes.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk eggs with the soy sauce, sesame oil, and salt. Gradually add the flour until incorporated. Fold in cabbage, scallions, and shrimp.

Warm a couple glugs of canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until glistening. Ladle the batter into the skillet as you would for regular old pancakes. I usually make them about the size of saucer. Cook on each side for about 3 minutes or until golden brown. Keep pancakes covered in a warm oven as you make the rest. Scatter sesame seeds on top of pancakes and serve drizzled with the spicy mayo sauce and a cold pilsner.
