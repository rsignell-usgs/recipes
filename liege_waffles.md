There are 10 steps in what follows, but they‚Äôre all pretty simple. Seriously. As long as you have a stand mixer, prepping the dough is a snap. Yet it‚Äôs also a 2-day process. So I often start my Day 1 mix at 2 in the afternoon and finish it up at 10 at night. The dough is all ready to bake the next day.

Now start mixing, and enjoy!

Liege Waffle Recipe / Gaufre de Li√®ge Recette

By Adam Wayda | Published: January 30, 2016

Prep time: 12 hours | Cook time: 2 minutes | Total time: 12 hours 02 mins

This is an excellent Li√®ge waffle recipe that will get you closer to the 19th-century style than all others but my metric version. | Yield: 6

INGREDIENTS
* 3/4 teaspoon of instant yeast
* 1/4 cup of warm water at 105¬∞F-110¬∞F
* 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs (warmed for several minutes in hot tap water)
* 2 Tablespoons of packed light brown sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon of salt
* 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoons of honey
* 11 Tablespoons of butter (slightly cooler than room temperature)
* 3/4 cup of pearl sugar

DIRECTIONS

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of warm water and allow it to stand for several minutes. Then add 1/2 cup of your flour and 1 egg. Mix to blend.

2. Cover the mixture with the remaining 1 cup of flour, but do not stir. Then cover the bowl in plastic wrap, and let it stand for 60 minutes (by which time the wet batter will be bubbling up through the flour).

3. Add the second egg, light brown sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and honey.

4. Affix the paddle attachment, and mix on speed #1 (the ‚Äústir‚Äù setting) ‚Äî scraping every few minutes ‚Äî until the dough forms a ball on the paddle. This should take about 15-20 minutes.

5. Begin adding the butter, a tablespoon at a time, over the next 5-7 minutes, scraping the bowl every couple minutes.

6. Once all the butter is completely added, continue mixing, scraping occasionally, until the dough again balls on the paddle. This should only take 2-6 minutes.

7. Scrape the dough into a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for 4 hours. Then put it into the refrigerator to rest overnight.

8. The next day, take the bowl of cold dough straight from the fridge and add all of the pearl sugar. It will seem like a lot of sugar, but it‚Äôs supposed to be üôÇ Mix it into the dough, by hand, until the chunks are well-distributed. Once mixed, divide the dough into 6 pieces of equal size.

9. Shape each piece into an oval ball (like a football without the pointy ends) and let it rise (covered loosely in plastic wrap) for 90 minutes.

10. If you have a professional waffle iron (meaning: it‚Äôs cast iron and weighs over 30 pounds) cook at exactly 355-360 degrees for approximately 2 minutes. If you have a regular home iron, it may take 4 minutes or longer.
