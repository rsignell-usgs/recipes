# Eggnog 
This boozy delicious recipe is from Jenny Putnam's dad.
Serves 6.  
* 2 eggs, separated
* 140 g sugar
* 5 oz bourbon
* 3 oz rum
* 3 oz whole milk
* 8 oz heavy cream
* 3 oz cognac
Beat the yolks until they are light and frothy, then add sugar and beat until smooth. 
Slowly stir in bourbon, rum, milk, cream and cognac (in that order!)
If time, refrigerate all ingredients until ready for serving, then:
Beat egg whites until stiff and then gently fold into mixture. 
Serve with a dusting of freshly grated nutmeg. 
If no time, serve with ice.
