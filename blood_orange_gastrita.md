### Blood orange-coriander gastrique

* 2 T coriander seeds
* 1 T fresh-squeezed lemon juice
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 2 T Water
* 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup fresh-squeezed blood orange juice
* 1/2 oz. vodka

Tools: Medium saucepan, pastry brush, fine-gauge strainer, sealable glass or plastic containers

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat coriander seeds until fragrant. Remove and set aside. Combine the lemon juice, sugar and water in the pan. Use a pastry brush to push sugar off the sides and into the liquid. When the mixture turns a rich brown, slowly stir in vinegar, followed by coriander seeds. Gradually add the blood orange juice and continue stirring until the mixture is a uniformly smooth, syrupy consistency. Remove from heat, and allow the mixture to cool. Strain out the coriander seeds. Add vodka to preserve freshness, and store in a sealed container in the refrigerator. A gastrique will keep for up to 6 weeks, although it will begin to lose its flavor sooner.
