## Best Pressure Cooker Black Bean Soup

* 2 T olive oil
* 2 cups chopped onion
* 3 T finely chopped cilantro stems
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 1 T minced chipotle pepper in adobo
* 1 T ground cumin
* 1 lb dried black beans
* 3 cups water
* 1 15 oz can tomatos (whole, diced, crushed, doesn't matter)
* Juice from 1 lime
* chicken bullion cubes (I use chicken "better than bullion")
* greek yogurt

Soak beans: in water for 7-8 hours (e.g. overnight or during the workday). Or use the quick soak: bring to boil and rest 1 hour. 

Heat oil in pressure cooker over medium heat, add onion and cumin and cook till softened, 3-4 mins. Turn to medium low, add garlic, cook for 2 mins. Drain the soaked beans and add to cooker with 3 cups water. When up to pressure, time 9 mins. Turn off and run under water to cool. Open and add drained tomatoes. Add water if necessary. Add chicken bouillon until salty enough. Add lime juice and serve with a big dollop of greek yogurt, cilantro leaves, and sriracha if desired.
