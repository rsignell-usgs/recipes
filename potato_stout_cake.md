# Potato Stout Cake

Potato and beer in a cake?
That's hard to beat. This is delicious:

Cake:
* 2 cups instant potato flakes
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 8 oz of Stout or Porter (I used Founders Breakfast Stout)
* 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 3/4 cups superfine sugar
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 2 eggs
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla
* 2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

Frosting:
* 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 3/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
1. Bring cream cheese to room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 F.
1. Coat sides and bottom of spring form pan with nonstick cooking spray
1. Melt stick of better in large,wide sauce pan.
1. Add beer, cocoa powder and superfine sugar and whisk until smooth. Remove from heat.
1. Whisk sour cream, eggs and vanilla until batter-like and slowly add to slightly cooled butter mixture
1. Add dry potato flakes and baking soda. Stir thoroughly. The batter will be grainy but don't worry.
1. Pour into springform pan and bake for 45-60 minutes. Done when wooden toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

1. Mix room-temperature cream cheese with powdered sugar and cream with a whisk. Adjust with more sugar or cream to reach right consistency for a thick but spreadable frosting.

Cake is even better the following day!
