## Farinata 

#### Ingredients
* 1 cup chickpea flour
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 1/4 cup lukewarm water
* 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* Ghee or oil, for pan

#### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, sift chickpea flour, salt, and pepper. Whisk in warm water and olive oil. 
1. Let sit, covered, for as many hours as possible (making this before you leave the house in the morning is perfect for making socca for dinner), but at least 30 minutes.
2. Place heavy (preferably cast-iron) skillet in oven and preheat to 450 F.
3. Remove skillet from oven. Add a small amount of oil or ghee to the hot pan, and pour batter in a steady stream until it reaches the edges of the pan. 
4. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the pancake is firm and the edges are set.
