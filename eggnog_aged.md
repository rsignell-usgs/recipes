# Aged Eggnog
## Ingredients
### 24 servings
* 12 egg yolks
* 18 oz. white sugar (fluid oz and oz weight are the same for sugar!)
* 36 oz. whole milk
* 24 oz. heavy cream
* 12 oz. aged rum
* 12 oz. Cognac
* 8 oz. bourbon
* ½ tsp. salt

### 4 servings
* 2 egg yolks
* 3 oz. white sugar (fluid oz and oz weight are the same for sugar!)
* 6 oz. whole milk
* 4 oz. heavy cream
* 2 oz. aged rum
* 2 oz. Cognac
* 1.5 oz. bourbon
* pinch of salt

## Instructions
Separate the eggs, and keep the whites to use somewhere else—like a merengue or your Whiskey Sour. 
Using an immersion blender or mixer, beat the yolks with the sugar in a large mixing bowl until the mixture lightens in color. 
Add dairy to a large bowl, then add the liquor and salt, then slowly beat in the egg mixture. 
Pour into glass jar or bottle and store in the fridge indefinitely. 
To serve, pour about 5 oz. into a small glass, and garnish with some freshly grated nutmeg.
