* 2 tablespoons Sichuan chili powder
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, toasted and ground

**Salad**
* ½ head napa cabbage, sliced thin (6 cups)

* 1 celery rib, sliced thin on bias

#### Directions

We prefer Sichuan chili powder, but Korean red pepper flakes, called gochugaru, are a good alternative. Rice vinegar can be substituted for black vinegar, if desired. Vary the amount of Sichuan peppercorns to suit your taste.

FOR THE CHICKEN: Cover chicken with plastic wrap and pound thick ends gently with meat pounder until ¾ inch thick. Whisk 4 quarts cool water with 2 tablespoons salt in Dutch oven. Arrange chicken in steamer basket, making sure not to overlap. Submerge steamer basket in pot. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally to even out hot spots, until water registers 175 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off heat, cover pot, remove pot from burner, and let stand until chicken registers 160 degrees, 17 to 22 minutes.

FOR THE DRESSING: While chicken cooks, combine vegetable oil, garlic, and ginger in bowl. Microwave until oil is hot and bubbling, about 2 minutes. Stir in chili powder and let cool for 10 minutes.

Strain oil mixture through fine-mesh strainer into large bowl; discard solids. Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, 1 teaspoon peppercorns, and sugar into strained oil. Add up to 1 teaspoon additional peppercorns to taste.

Transfer chicken to cutting board and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Shred chicken lengthwise into long, thin strips. Add chicken to bowl with dressing and toss to coat. Season with salt to taste.

FOR THE SALAD: Toss cabbage, 1 cup cilantro, two-thirds of scallions, celery, and pinch salt in second large bowl. Arrange cabbage mixture in even layer on large platter. Mound chicken on top of cabbage mixture and sprinkle with remaining ½ cup cilantro, remaining scallions, and sesame seeds, if using. Serve.
