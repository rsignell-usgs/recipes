## Tonic Syrup (for Tonic Water) 

Quantity: about 1 pint

#### Ingredients:

* 1 cup water
* 1 1/3 cups pure cane sugar
* 1 Tbsp. cinchona bark (I bought online from Penn Herb )
* 2 Tbsp. powdered citric acid (I bought online from Amazon )
* 1 lime
* 1 stalk, fresh lemongrass, diced (Note: fresh is way better, but you can substitute 1/2 tsp cut dried lemongrass, which I also found online from Penn Herb )

### Instructions

1. In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and water to a boil until the sugar dissolves, then turn the heat down to low. 
1. Add the quinine, citric acid, lemongrass, lime zest and lime juice. 
1. Stir well and simmer for about 25 minutes. The syrup will be thin and runny. 
1. Remove from heat and let cool. 
1. Strain out the large chunks through a tea strainer or fine mesh colander into a 1 pint mason jar. 

Will keep for a month or more in the refrigerator. 
Use about 1/2 oz of syrup with 3 to 5 oz of sparking water and 1.5 oz gin for an awesome gin and tonic.
