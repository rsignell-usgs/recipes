# Fresh Pea Soup
Serves 4 to 6
Only 5 ingredients, and takes only 20 minutes start to finish!

* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 cups coarsely chopped onion
* 1/2 t cayenne pepper
* 4 cups frozen petite peas (about 1 lb)
* 4 cups chicken stock

#### Instructions  

- saute onions in oil until soft on medium heat in a dutch oven or heavy pan (about 3 min)
- add cayenne pepper (cook for 1 min more)
- add frozen peas and 2 cups chicken stock
- turn up heat to medium-high and cook until stock just starts to boil
- remove from heat

  (you can use an immersion blender but it probably won't get velvety smooth)

Salt and pepper to taste.
