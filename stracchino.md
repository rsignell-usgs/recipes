## Stracchino

* Put 1 gallon of raw milk on stove over medium heat. Bring to 99 degrees F stirring often with a wooden spoon.
* Put 1 cup of plain greek yogurt (any brand containing both L. Bulgaricus and S. Thermophilus should work, but I use Chobani) in a 2 cup measuring cup and whisk in 1 cup of the warm milk to make a better consistency for adding to the pot.
* Add yogurt back into the milk in the pot. Add 4 drops of liquid animal rennet diluted in 1/3 cool spring water. Let stand at 100 degrees for 90 min. (note: rennet loses potency with age. I used 8 drops of 3.5 year old rennet and it worked great)
* Cut curd vertically into large pieces, and ladle with slotted spoon into cheesecloth lined cheese molds. If you don't line the mold with cheesecloth, the cheese fills the holes and doesn't drain as well.
* Rest the molds on a splatter screen over a 13x9 pan to drain. Let sit draining in the the cheese molds at room temperature for 12 hours, prying the edges of the cheese away from the cheesecloth with a knife as it sinks.
* Remove the cheeses, wrap the cheesecloth around them, flip them and put them back in the molds.
* Flip the cheese, put back in the molds
* Let rest in molds at room temp for another 12 hours.
* Soak in brine (4 cups cool 50 F spring water + 4 T kosher salt) in bread loaf pan for 1 hour.
* Put bamboo sushi mat in bottom of bread loaf pan, rest cheeses wrapped in their cheesecloth on top, cover with plastic wrap and put in fridge to ripen for 1 week.
* Eat before it turns bad! It only lasts about 1 additional week after it's ripened!

Notes: I made my own cheese molds by drilling a bunch of 1/8 inch holes in two 1.8L "lock-lock" brand rectangular plastic containers
